 NOTES
 -----------------
 Option -uri is used to specify the URI of the broker and option -n is to specify the neighbors.
• A broker URI must have the format of <comm protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/<broker id>.
The comm protocol can be either ‘rmi’ or ‘socket’; hostname can be the DNS name or the IP address
of the machine where the broker is instantiated; port is the port number where the broker is listening
at for incoming connections; and broker id is the unique identifier of the broker.
• Only one broker can listen at a particular port of a given host.
• Broker ID must be unique and should not contain the ‘-’ (hyphen) character.
• The neighbors are given in a comma separated (with no space) list of broker URIs.
• When two brokers are connected in the overlay, it is enough to specify the neighborhood relation only
at one side (in the above example, only BrokerA uses the -n option).
• There is no stipulated order in which the brokers have to be started. Brokers will detect whether the
specified neighbors are alive by periodically sending connection requests.
